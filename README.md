2024/04/22~2024/09/18 我開始在資策會學習java，
記錄每一次上課後得課後作業以及我認為我不識很熟悉的地方，
藉由不斷練習和添加一些功能讓我熟練此技能 

From April 22, 2024, to September 18, 2024, I will be studying Java at the iSpan. 
After each class, I plan to record all the homework assignments and areas that I feel are not yet familiar to me. 
Through continuous practice and by adding new functionalities, I aim to master this skill.
